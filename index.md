### Business Improv

#### Basics of improvising
- Improvisation is the ability to create and implement a new or an unplanned solution in the face of an unexpected problem or change. It is often seen as a spontaneous, intuitive, creative problem-solving behavior that mostly happens “on the fly.”
- Listening to what the person speaks and even if you are told "no" we just have to agree and supplement that affirmation, with a notion to support our ideas.
- Whatever the person is saying, we say yes to that idea and express our support, not shut down and condenscend them.
- We are gonna respect what they are saying, see if we can work around that and take it somewhere else, in place of saying "No, but", saying "Yes, and"
- Three questions we have to answer "Why should you do it?", "Why right here?", and "Why right now?"
